# database-backup-automation-service-generator
Since there are so many project that using database and need to be backup frequently to avoid lost of data, and to do the auto backup process we need to create service file blah blah blah that could take so much time. And all we do is just same thing from one server to other.
So this script will mainly automate generate everything including service and timer file base on what user want. After this finish there will be also a automation script to automate the auto upload those backup to Google drive too.
